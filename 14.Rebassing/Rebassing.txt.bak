git rebase <branch name> - This command is used for rebasing the project. The rebase is used for like when we use git merge it will combine from 2 branch and make a new commit id.
But if we use a git rebase then the commit id will be created newly for existing branch. The commit id from the merging branch will be same.

2. git rebase --abort - this will abort when there is conflict.
3. or fix the conflict then run the command git add . and git rebase --continue
4. git rebase -i HEAD~4 = this command is used for like if we want to reword the commit or edit or drop etc.. so after that commit id every commit id after that will change.
  we can use reword, fixup, pick etc..
