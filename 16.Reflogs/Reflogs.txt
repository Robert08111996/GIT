1.git reflog show HEAD - This is the most commonly used command.It will show all reflog. In git there will be .git folder, inside that .git folder there will be reflogs <D:\GIT\Merge\.git\logs>
that only it will display.

6.git reflog master@{one.week.ago} -It will show the reflog of master that is one week ago.

Suppose we made some changes and unfortunetly we deleted that commit using git reset --hard "commit id" , then entire things will be lost. But that entry will be present in 
reflog, that can be retrived using git reset --hard master@{1} like this. Instead of master@{1} we can use our needs.
